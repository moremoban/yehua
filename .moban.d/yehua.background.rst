The original problem I was trying to solve is: I would like to place
common paragraphs in the documentation of my projects in a central
place (pyexcel-mobans), and all projects could reference it dynamically
so that when those common paragraphs get updated, the updates can be
easily propagated to all relevant projects. The derived problem is:
what could I do to a new project? I found myself doing a lot of
copy-and-paste a lot, which lead to the creation of "yehua". Later,
John Vandenberg, an active member of coala, suggested extracting the
generic sets of pyexcel-mobans to form pypi-mobans, so that
a vanilla python package can be created.


Why to choose "yehua"? Here is `the little story<https://github.com/moremoban/yehua/issues/5#issuecomment-317218010>`_ behind the choice of name. And this `music video<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JFTOQ6F1-M&frags=pl%2Cwn>`_ would help bridge the cultural gap between you and me.
